SnooMD is a markdown editor for Reddit Bots.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Simply require the package, and use the functions to enhance your text posts.


### Installing

    Markdown
} = require('SnooMD');

```


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

How to format your markdown strings:

```javascript
const MarkdownString =
`Hello There! ${md.apply("Bolded Text!", md.bold)}\n
This will be ${md.superscript("SUPERSCRIPTED!")}\n
Here is a fancy codeblock:\n
${md.apply('console.log(markdown)',md.codeblock)}\n
Here is a named link: ${md.link("https://www.google.com","search")}\n
Here is some fenced text: \n${md.fence("Fenced text here for ya")}`
```
Logging this string will result in this:
~~~javascript
Hello There! __Bolded Text!__ 

This will be ^(SUPERSCRIPTED!)

Here is a fancy codeblock:    

`console.log(markdown)`       

Here is a named link: [search](https://www.google.com)

Here is some fenced text:
```javascript
Fenced text here for ya
```
~~~

You can easily create tables by using the table function:

```javascript
// Tables
const row1 = {
    rating: "5",
    type: "Trade",
    comments: "https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
}
const row2 = {
    rating: "2",
    type: "Giveaway",
    comments: `https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3`
}
const row3 = {
    rating: "1",
    type: "Sale",
    comments: "https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
}
const t = md.table(["Rating", "Type", "Comments"], [row1,row2,row3])
```
This will result in text formatted as such:
```javascript
|Rating|Type|Comments|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|5|Trade|https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3|
|2|Giveaway|https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3|
|1|Sale|https://www.reddit.com/r/s/g6j7nix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3|
```

<h1>How to use this bot?</h1>

Users may submit reviews to this [bot command thread](/r/Bwz3rBot/comments/jaha01).

Commands must be formated with a directive of `!rate`. The first command argument must be the name of the user to be updated. The second argument must be a rating number between 1 and 5 followed by the word stars. The next arg must be the type of interaction. Was it either (a. sale, b. trade, c. giveaway)? If no type is specified, it defaults to a sale. All arguments following interaction type will be converted to a string, and will go into the comments section of the review. Command MUST contain an interaction type of you wish to include a comment.

`!rate u/Bwz3r 5 stars sale We had a great interaction! I'm rating u/Bwz3r 5 stars!`

This command will be processed by the bot and will find u/Bwz3r within the database. If the user does not exist within the database, the user will be added to the list of reviewed users and will retain the rating given along with any comments, and a link to the command comment. Any future ratings received by this user will be added to their file and any changes made will be instantly updated in the user directory under their alphabetized page. Users scores will be averaged according to number of reviews / scores rounded down. Stars will be awarded each user according to their calculated average rating. Any questions or errors found while using the bot can be submitted to u/Bwz3r. Thank you for reading!
